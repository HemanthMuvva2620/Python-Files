# Telco Customer Churn Analysis
This project involves analyzing customer churn in the telecom industry using the Telco Customer Churn dataset. The primary goal is to identify factors contributing to customer churn and develop predictive models to assist in customer retention strategies.

# Getting Started
Load the data set

# Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Required Python libraries (listed in requirements.txt)
# breakdown of test
The project includes various tests to evaluate the performance of machine learning models on the Telco Customer Churn dataset. Tests include: Data preprocessing and cleaning Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Model training and evaluation (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests) Model comparison and selection
